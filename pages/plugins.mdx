# Plugins

Elite Observatory Core was built to be highly modular and does essentially nothing without plugins. Naturally this would not be a particularly useful package to install in that condition, so the commonly distributed version of Observatory is bundled with three plugins out-of-the-box.

## Core Plugins

* [Explorer](/plugins/explorer): Astronomical feature cataloguing.
* [Botanist](/plugins/botanist): Simple biological signal cataloguing.
* [Herald](/plugins/herald): High-quality spoken notifications.

## Third-Party Plugins

Observatory also exposes an internal set of interfaces allowing other developers to create and distribute their own plugins. What follows is a partial list of those currently available. If you know of any not on this list reach out via the [forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-observatory-search-your-journal-for-potentially-interesting-objects-or-notify-you-of-new-ones-on-the-fly-while-exploring.521544/) or [discord](https://discord.gg/RAFDHsY).

Precise installation instructions can be found for any given plugin on its own page.

*If a plugin is marked `(BETA)`, it is not complete and you may encounter issues while using it.*
