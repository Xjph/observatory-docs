  * **Found:** Displays a symbol depending on the status of the signal.
    * ‚ùî if the signal has been predicted but unconfirmed
    * ‚úîÔ∏è if the signal has been predicted and confirmed
    * üî∑ if the signal is unconfirmed and might be a new codex entry
    * ‚ùå if the signal is unpredicted (unexpected behaviour)
  * **Type:** The type of geological signal.
  * **Body Type:** The type of body containing the signal.
  * **Materials:** Displays the materials (and their percentage) that compose the body.
  * **Volcanism:** The volcanism of the body, as per the System Map
