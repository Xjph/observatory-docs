As with other plugins, Evaluator categorises its output: 

  * **System:** The current system.
  * **Body:** The current body.
  * **Type:** Indicates the type of body.
  * **Distance:** The distance in Ls from the main star.
  * **Gravity:** The gravity (where applicable) of the body.
  * **Terraformable:** Whether a body is terraformable (if applicable).
  * **Current Value:** The current value of the body.
  * **Potential Max Value**: The potential maximum value of the body (i.e. if DSSed).
  * **Map:** Whether to map the body or not. If the body is high-value enough, this will be Yes.
  * **Order:** If there are multiple bodies worth mapping, indicates the order in which to map them.
  * **Done:** Indicates whether the body has been mapped fully.
  * **Total Value:** The total value of the system.

Evaluator features a number of settings that can be customised (under the Observatory Evaluator dropdown in the Core tab).

  * **Maximum Systems to show after Read All [VALUE]:** Sets the maximum amount of systems to display after performing a Read All action.

Buttons:

  * **Atmospherics worth mapping:** Enables/disables checks for atmospheric bodies.
  * **Notifications for bodies worth mapping:** Enables/disables [[notifications|notifications]].
