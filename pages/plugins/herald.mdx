# Herald

Herald is a core [plugin](/plugins) for the Observatory, designed to provide cloud-based high-quality speech synthesis.

*Note: Herald is separate from the [built-in voice notifications](/notifications#voice-notifications) in Observatory Core (found under the 'Voice Notifications' dropdown).*

## Installation

  * Herald comes preinstalled with Observatory Core by default.
  * If manual installation is required, create a 'plugins' folder in the same place as Observatory Core.exe. Add ObservatoryHerald.dll to this folder.
  * If installation is successful, under the Core tab there should now be a dropdown for Observatory Herald.

## Usage

Herald has several options to customise:

  * **Voice:** Select the desired voice for synthesis.
  * **Rate:** Control the playback speed of the voice.
  * **Cache Size:** Select the cache size for synthesis data on-device (in megabytes).

In addition, there is a volume slider, a test button, and a button to enable or disable Herald.
