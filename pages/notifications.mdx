# Notifications

Observatory is able to notify you of the data it reads, without having to directly look at the application. 

There are two methods of notification available:

* [Popup Notifications](#popup-notifications)
* [Voice Notifications](#voice-notifications)

Notifications (whether popups or voice) will trigger simultaneously upon finding a point of interest: The exact things Observatory notifies you of can be customised with [plugins](/plugins).

## Popup Notifications

Popup notifications, as the name suggests, 'pop up' on your screen, overlaying your game (or other windows, if your prefer). This is especially useful on single-monitor machines, where it is not feasible to have Observatory open at the same time as Elite.

Several configuration options exist for pop-up notifications: 

  * **Display:** Select the display on which to show notifications.
  * **Corner:** Select the corner of the display in which to show notifications.
  * **Font:** Select the font for notifications.
  * **Scale:** Select the percentage scale for the notifications.
  * **Duration:** Select the duration (in milliseconds) for which the notification stays on your screen.

There is also a colour picker, a test button and a button to enable or disable pop-ups completely.

## Voice Notifications

Voice notifications use speech synthesis to 'speak' notifications, and can be used either alongside pop-ups or on their own. 

*Note: This is a separate feature to the [Herald](/plugins/herald) plugin.*

The Voice Notifications dropdown allows you to select the built-in voice to use. In addition there are sliders for the volume and speed at which the notifications are read, a test button and a button to enable or disable voice notifications entirely.
