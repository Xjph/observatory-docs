# Wine-Friendly Build

> As of version 1.2.5 **Wine 10.0+ is required.** For previous versions you will need **Wine 9.0+**. Prior versions have issues with .NET 8. If using Lutris you may need to change the application config if the default Wine environment is something older.

## Latest 

### v1.2.8 - Persistent Fixes

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.2.8/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.2.8/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Please see the [regular release page](/release) for changelogs.

### v1.2.5 - Pop a Tab

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.2.5/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.2.5/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

I have only personally verified this using Wine 10.0-rc5. Please let me know if you find other configurations that work. Most notably I've not tested it using SteamOS's Proton or Proton-GE.

## Previous Builds

### v1.1.4 - Non-Blocking Error

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.4/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.4/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

No changes specific to the experimental build.

### v1.1.3 - Quick Ascendancy Bugfix

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.3/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.3/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

In addition to the fixes on the main release page, this version should correct the build issues that prevented the 1.1.2 experimental build from working in most Wine environments.

### v1.1.2 - Minor Botanist Fix

> NOTE: There have been reports that this build is not functional in WINE/Proton. Feel free to try it, but it's currently recommended to remain on v1.1.1.

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.2/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.2/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Fixes a minor issue in Botanist where the UI would not update after scanning a body.

### v1.1.1 - Make it Pop!

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.1/WINE-ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://xjph.net/Observatory/1.1.1/WINE-ObservatoryPortable.zip)

This version has a handful of fixes specific to this build which are listed below. For general fixes and features in this version refer to the [main release page](/release). Of note the new settings for popup transparency is recommended as the transparent popups do not present as intended on linux, at least in my own experience. Disabling this should *greatly* improve readability.

In addition there is now a "portable" bundle available. This should be easier to setup for use via Steam Play for any user inclined to do so, while the installer is a smoother experience if using Lutris.

- Improve settings handling to not wipe out previously saved settings
- Handle settings saving/loading using the "portable" logic for both builds to avoid strange appdata interactions within WINE
- Attempt to pick a sensible default location for the journal folder (assumes Steam version of Elite Dangerous)

### v1.1.0 - Centered and Signed

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://xjph.net/Observatory/ObservatoryWineSetup.exe)

This is an experimental and likely bug-riddled version with some build-time tweaks to improve compatibility with Wine.

**Wine 9.0+ is required.** Prior versions have issues with .NET 8. You may need to change the application config in Lutris if the default Wine environment is something older.

You *may* need to manually specify your journal folder location. Double click the journal path in the core tab to change it. (This is intentionally obfuscated as people breaking their install by accidentally changing the path to something invalid had become an ongoing problem.) You'll likely have an easier time locating it if you enable the options under "drives" in your wine configuration to show dot files.

For whatever reason it fails to correctly default to a valid audio device, if you want to hear [Herald](/usage/plugins/herald) notifications you will need to select the "Wine Audio Mapper" in the audio device dropdown on the core tab.

Dark theme is a bit wonky, you will likely need to switch to light. This is also found at the bottom of the core tab.

If you try this please let me know how it goes. I've only given it the most cursory of initial testing, basically just making sure it runs.
