Release versions:

The long-awaited return of [the Herald plugin](/usage/plugins/herald)!

Last November I was forced to take Herald offline; a sudden spike in usage caused the cost of providing the Azure based voices to become unsustainable. At the time I said that at some future date it may return as a Patreon bonus for those supporting the project, and now that day has arrived. Anyone backing the project on Patreon *at any tier* will have access to Herald via the Observatory API.

Users with their own Azure Cognitive Services account can use Herald with their own subscription key, avoiding the need for a Patreon pledge should you already have access to Azure Cognitive Services.

Alternatively, Herald can be used with an OpenAI voice model. This requires access to a speech service providing an OpenAI speech API endpoint. Use of OpenAI is a beta feature and you may encounter bugs or odd behaviours. Notably, the OpenAI API does not support the use of SSML which is used internally by Observatory for both native voice notifications and by Herald to control the manner in which some voice lines are spoken, so raw text is used instead. This may result in some voice lines sounding odd or unnatural, *e.g.*, "Body AB 1" may have "AB" read as a single word rather than individually spelling out "A B". If you encounter any other issues with the OpenAI API please report them on the [forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-observatory-search-your-journal-for-potentially-interesting-objects-or-notify-you-of-new-ones-on-the-fly-while-exploring.521544/) or [discord](https://discord.gg/RAFDHsY) so I can investigate.
