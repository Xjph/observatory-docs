# Herald

Herald is a core [plugin](/usage/plugins) for Observatory, designed to provide cloud-based higher-quality speech synthesis.

> *Note: Herald is separate from the [built-in voice notifications](/usage/notifications#voice-notifications) in Observatory Core (found under the 'Voice Notifications' dropdown).*

## Installation

  * Herald comes preinstalled with Observatory Core by default.
  * If manual installation is required, create a 'plugins' folder in the same location as Observatory's executable. Add ObservatoryHerald.dll to this folder.
  * If installation is successful it will be listed in the plugins list on the Core tab.

## Usage

import Image from 'next/image'

![The Herald settings window.](/herald-example.png)
*The Herald settings window.*

Herald has several options to customise:

  * **Voice:** Select the desired voice for synthesis.
  * **Rate:** Control the playback speed of the voice.
  * **Cache Size:** The maximum size of the local cache for voice samples. Having locally cached voice lines will improve response time for frequent notifications and reduce network traffic.
  * **Test:** Speaks a simple test line using the currently selected voice.
