# Signal Monitor

SignalMonitor is an optional [plugin](/usage/plugins) for Observatory, designed to report upon certain interesting signals while exploring.

## Installation

  * Make sure you already have Observatory [downloaded](/release).
  * Navigate to https://edjp.colacube.net/observatory and download SignalMonitor.
  * Double-click the downloaded .eop file to install it into Observatory.
  * SignalMonitor is now ready to use.

## Usage
  * SignalMonitor detects Notable Stellar Phenomena, Unregistered Comms Beacons and Listening Posts in systems.
  * When one of the above signals is detected, its timestamp, system and type will be displayed in Observatory.
  * SignalMonitor will send a configurable [notification](/usage/notifications) for these events.
      * Some Notable Stellar Phenomena may not show up until further scans, or in rare cases, at all. This is due to missing functionality by Elite and is no fault of the plugin.
