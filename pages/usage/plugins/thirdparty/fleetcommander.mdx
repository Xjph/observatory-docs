# Fleet commander

This plugin is an essential assistant for Carrier owners who regularly move their carriers. Features:

*   Tracks carrier tritium levels
*   Tracks jump cooldowns and notifies you when you can schedule a new jump (taking into account the actual jump time provided by the game).
*   [Beta] Supports Spansh Carrier route plotting and injects the next jump into the system clipboard after jump cooldown ends.
*   [Beta] Supports multiple commanders with carriers.
*   [Beta] Has a shiny UI which includes on-screen countdowns (jump and cooldown).

## Tips

*   Perform a read-all after installing v0.24.143.0120-beta. The tips for previous versions are no longer relevant
    because known carriers are now cached and thus always known (for all commanders).
*   If the plugin loses track of where your carrier position while following a route, right-click the system you're
    in within the route listbox and select "Set current position". Tracking carrier position based on journal data is quite difficult.

For previous versions (Observatory Core &lt;= 0.2.x):

*   You need to interact with the carrier in some way (docking, opening carrier management, etc) for your carrier to be detected
    (it looks for a CarrierStats event). This version of the plugin was statelesss!
*   As long as you don't restart Observatory Core, it will tell you when the jump cooldown has ended even with the game client closed.
