# Prospector

Prospector is a miner's must-have tool, assisting you through the entire prospecting and mining workflow. Features include:

*   A configurable list of commodities you are looking for in settings.
*   Rings which may contain these commodities are called out when detected via FSS.
*   Rings which contain hotspots for these commodities are called out when probed via DSS.
*   While mining, it will call out rocks which exceed the threshold (in settings) of material, or cores.
    *   Note that the game does not provide any information on surface and sub-surface deposits, so you still need to use the Contacts panel for that.
*   Provides a handy overlay of what's in your cargo hold (including limpets!)
*   Plus miscellaneous session statistics.

TODO/Wishlist:

*  Notify if you are undocking in a ship with mining gear but without limpets in cargo!
