# Aggregator

The Notification Aggregator plugin is effectively a notification log -- collecting notifications from all other plugins
into one place to reduce the number of times you need to switch between plugins. When supported, Aggregator can display
extended information not visible in the source plugin or other modes of notification (ie. popup, voice).

## Features of the 1.0.x release

*   A DataGridView-based UI grouped by body with a summary row showing key values for each body. Notifications
    associated with each body grouped below. Body summaries with no associated notifications can be hidden (default).
    Hover over the icons in the system and body summary rows to see an explanation of what they mean. (There's also a
    guide below in the Tips section.)
*   The font size is scalable (larger or smaller relative to the app default application font size).
*   Provides an "interest tracking" column -- details below.
*   A "jump to plugin" feature -- Click on the plugin name in the "Sender" column to focus the plugin which generated
    the notification.
*   Supports multiple commanders.
*   Is themeable to a degree.

The ‚úÖ or "Interest Tracking" column allows you to mark notifications with intent to visit.
*   While FSSing the system, target a body to mark it as interesting. Alternatively, you can manually click the üîç icon to mark something as interesting. When marked, the column displays an empty checkbox icon (denoting it as something to do).
*   When you've either DSSed or landed on a marked body, the empty checkbox will automatically be checked (‚úÖ). Alternatively, click the empty checkbox to check it. Note that this marked completed state is not persisted.
*   In any state, right-clicking the column will reset to the default state (üîç). Clicking on an already completed item will also cycle back to the initial state.

See the [Changelog page](https://github.com/fredjk-gh/ObservatoryPlugins/wiki/Plugin:-Aggregator) for release notes and the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/fredjk-gh/ObservatoryPlugins/wiki) for download links or install via the AutoUpdater.

## Tips

*   Older versions of plugins will not support all available features (for example grouping with other notifications
    for the same body or the jump-to-plugin feature). For the best experience, keep your plugins up-to-date!
*   Several icons are used. Here's what they mean:
    *   System-level:
        *   üÜï: System is undiscovered.
        *   üíØ: All bodies have been scanned (FSSAllBodiesFound event has fired).
        *   ‚õΩ: System contains a scoopable star.
    *    Body-level:
        *   ‚òÄ: Body is a star
            *   ‚õΩ: Indicates the star is scoopable.
        *   ü™ê: Body is a gas giant
        *   üåè: Body is an earthlike
        *   üåë: Body is some other planet type (MR, HMC, RB, IB, WW, AW)
        *   üí∞: Body is high value (ELW, WW, AW or Terraformable)
        *   üåê: Body has been mapped by the current commander
        *   üõ¨: Body is landable
        *   üß¨: Body has biological signals (includes count)
        *   üåã: Body has geological signals (includes count)

## Settings

*   Exclude matching (| separated literals)
    *   Notifications matching this filter will not be included in the grid. You can provide multiple values by separating
        them with `|`. This setting does not take effect until the next notification arrives.
    *   Default: (Empty)
*   Show all body summaries even if no notification
    *   By default, Notification Aggregator will not show a body summary until a notification for that body arrives.
        Turn this setting on to show all body summaries. Note that this will require a lot of scrolling in systems with many bodies.
    *   Default: off.
*   Font Size adjustment
    *   Adjusts the font size (ie. zoom) relative to the current app-wide font size. Range is -5 - +10
    *   Default: 0 (no zoom).

## Integration guide for Plugin Authors

The Notification Aggregator plugin's primary inputs are:
*   A small subset of Journal events including:
    *   FSDJump
    *   Location
    *   LoadGame
    *   Loadout
    *   FSSAllBodiesFound
    *   FSSDiscoveryScan
    *   FSSBodySignals
    *   Scan
    *   SAAScanComplete
    *   Touchdown
*   Notifications from other plugins.

If you are a plugin author and would like your plugin to leverage all the features of the Notification Aggregator, please follow the guidelines below:

*   Populate the fields in `NotificationArgs` with `NotificationRendering.All` or `.PluginNotifier` as follows:
    *   For notifications associated with a body (ie. Scan):
        *   Set the CoalescingId property to the BodyID from the Journal entry. CoalescingIds in the range 0 - 1000 are reserved for bodies.
        *   I recommend setting the "Title" for such notifications to `Body ${BodyShortName}` (eg. "Body 1 a") to match the Summary name.
            Titles which match the Body Summary name will be suppressed to provide visual grouping.
    *   Additional Special CoalescingIds:
        *   -2 Alerts
        *   -1 System notifications
        *   1001 Default "catch-all" which appear in the "Other notifications" group
    *   For all notifications:
        *   Provide additional helpful detail in the ExtendedDetails property. The content here is not included in any NativeVisual nor NativeVoice notifiers.
        *   Set the Sender property to the short name of your plugin (the same value that appears on the plugin's Tab in the main window). This allows
            Aggregator to focus your plugin when the button in the Sender column is clicked.
