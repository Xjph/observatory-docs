# Helm

Provides a few about your flight environment plus some extra features.

*   Supports multiple commanders.
*   Tracks the last plotted route for each commander. When the game is loaded, injects the last plotted destination
    into the system clipboard (because sometimes the game forgets after switching commanders).
*   Provides low fuel warnings - in addition to pointing out scoopable stars in system.
    *   It has a specific mode for neutron jumping: it calls out close by secondary stars to refuel from (at a
        configurable maximum distance).
*   Gives a heads-up about high gravity if you're approaching a body to land on it (configurable threshold).
*   Tracks route progress and captures some miscellaneous session stats.

This plugin is still in Beta.
