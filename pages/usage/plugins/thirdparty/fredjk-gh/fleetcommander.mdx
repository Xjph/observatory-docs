# Fleet commander

This plugin is an essential assistant for Carrier owners who regularly move their carriers. Features:

*   Tracks carrier tritium levels, used capacity and carrier balance. These displays have tool-tips with more detail.
*   Tracks jump cooldowns and notifies you when you can schedule a new jump (taking into account the actual jump time provided by the game).
*   Supports Spansh Carrier route plotting and injects the next jump into the system clipboard after jump cooldown ends.
*   Supports multiple commanders with carriers.
*   Provides on-screen countdowns (for jump and cooldown) which can be popped out into a resizable window (which remembers its size and position).
*   Is fully [themable](/usage/themes).

See the [Changelog page](https://github.com/fredjk-gh/ObservatoryPlugins/wiki/Plugin:-Fleet-Commander) for release notes and the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/fredjk-gh/ObservatoryPlugins/wiki) for download links or install via the AutoUpdater.

## Tips

*   Perform a read-all after installing v1.x to discover known carriers. Known carriers are now cached and thus always known (for all commanders) once the read-all is complete.
*   The carrier balance, used capacity and tritium levels can be refreshed by opening the carrier admin UI in-game. The tooltip for these fields indicate last time these values were refreshed.
*   If the plugin loses track of where your carrier position while following a route, right-click the system you're in within the route listbox and select "Set current position". Tracking carrier position based on journal data is quite difficult.
