# AutoUpdater

This plugin keeps all plugins listed here (including itself) up-to-date after installation. After a release of an
installed plugin is posted to GitHub, it will download the updated versions so it can be used after ObservatoryCore
is restarted.  You can also install other plugins using the new UI (Beta).

After installing other plugins and restarting ObservatoryCore, be sure to look at the plugin's options and adjust as you like.

NOTE: To enable auto-updating any plugin listed as "Beta", you will need to enable the "Use beta versions" option.
