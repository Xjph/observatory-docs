# Archivist

The Archivist plugin captures exploration related journals and stores them in a database for later re-use either by
re-sending journal entries to other plugins or by allowing you to search/browse the journal entries yourself (pretty
printed) and copy them out for other uses. This plugin includes:

*   Support for multiple commanders.
*   A UI to view new records as they arrive (pretty printed) with a pop-out viewer window and a search functionality
    to find entries for a previously visited system, with filtering options to help narrow down the results.
*   Experimental support for resending records from search results to all enabled plugins.

This plugin is still in Beta.

See the [Changelog page](https://github.com/fredjk-gh/ObservatoryPlugins/wiki/Plugin:-Archivist) for release notes and download links or install via the AutoUpdater.

## Tips

*   Requires running a "Read All" to backfill the database after installation!
*   Resending records is highly experimental; use with caution. It can spawn dozens of notifications and mess up
    stored data for other plugins. I recommend having only specific plugins enabled when you resend records, otherwise
    you may have to re-read all to fix things afterward.
