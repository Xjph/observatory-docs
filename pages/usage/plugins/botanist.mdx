# Botanist

Botanist is a core [plugin](/usage/plugins) for Observatory, designed to provide simple output for biological signals.

*Note: There is an optional plugin, [BioInsights](/usage/plugins/thirdparty/bioinsights), that expands upon the capabilities of Botanist.*


## Installation

  * Botanist comes pre-installed with Observatory Core by default.
  * If manual installation is required, create a 'plugins' folder in the same location as Observatory's executable. Add ObservatoryBotanist.dll to this folder.
  * When starting Observatory, if successful, there should be a Botanist tab along the top.

Botanist divides its output into subsections: 

  * **Body:** The name of the body on which the biological was found.
  * **Bio Total:** The total amount of biological signals on a given body.
  * **Species:** The type of biological signal scanned. Only scanned species will show up.
    * If no samples for a given a planet are taken then (NO SAMPLES TAKEN) will be displayed instead.
  * **Analysed:** Displays whether the signal has been analysed or not.
  * **Colony Distance:** Displays the clonal colony range of the signal as per the Codex.
