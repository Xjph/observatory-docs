# Troubleshooting

Below is a list of FAQs for Observatory installation and setup. 

  * **I can't see/launch Observatory!**
      * Make sure you downloaded ObservatorySetup.exe- by default this should put Observatory in the your application list/Start Menu.
      * If you downloaded ObservatoryCore.zip (the portable version) then you may need to extract and run the application from there.
  * **Observatory can't read any of my data!**
      * You may need to set your journal path in the Core section of Observatory. In Windows, this path is usually C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous.
      * If you aren't sure where your journal files are, you can search for them in Windows' File Explorer by typing `Journal.*.log` into the search bar. Once you've found the folder your files are in, set Observatory's path to that folder.
      * Test that your journal folder is correct by clicking the Read All button. If you have any historical journal data, then this should now appear in Observatory.
  * **Observatory freezes/crashes when I click 'Read All!'**
    * For CMDRS with very large amounts of journal files, the Read All button may take a long time to process (up to a few minutes on slower systems). On older versions of Observatory, this will make the application unresponsive until complete.
