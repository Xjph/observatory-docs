# Observatory Core Downloads

If you are looking for the pre-release testing version [you can find it here](/release/prerelease).

## Latest

### v0.2.23060.2034 - Export Options

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v0.2.23060.2034/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v0.2.23060.2034/ObservatoryCore.zip)

This release adds a feature that several people have asked for, courtesy of [fredjk-gh](https://github.com/fredjk-gh). The export format can now be changed between the defaulted fixed width output and a tab separated file for ease of use with automated processing tools and spreadsheet programs. Find the option to change this in the new "Export Options" pane of the core tab.

Of interest to plugin developers, there is a new `AddGridItems` method which can add multiple rows to a plugin UI grid in only a single call, which should improve performance for large changes to the grid.

In addition there are a number of bug fixes for edge case error conditions, and some minor tweaks for behaviour of *linux* builds courtesy of [cerus](https://github.com/cerus), who has also provided an *unofficial* linux build of Observatory, which you can find here: https://github.com/cerus/observatorycore-linux
