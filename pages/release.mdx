Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.4/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.4/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

~~Three, count them, _three_ bugfix releases since 1.2.0!~~

Some small issues were identified with 1.2.3, so we're up to four!

Simple audio chimes are now available for notifications as well, for those who wanted some kind of audio alert, but didn't care to have them spoken.

This update also includes a refactor of the plugin settings window. It should now be somewhat more compact and behave better on differently sized displays.

- Added "Chime" option for audio notifications
- Major refactor of plugin settings window
- Fix an issue where numeric plugin settings could cause an error if they specified a minimum value above 0 (fredjk)
- Added `DirectoryInfo` as a valid datatype for plugin settings
- Corrected behaviour for internally focusing a plugin while popped out (fredjk)
- Restore missing "Plugin Folder" button
- Corrected handling of application audio to not mess with windows mixer
- Update behaviour when installing plugin from double-click of .eop file to automatically restart Observatory
- Expanded framework notifier interface to include necessary information for persisted notifications
- (1.2.4) Fix an issue in Botanist where re-played journals without accompanying Status file data could cause errors
- (1.2.4) Relax "on screen" requirement when restoring plugin popout locations to be in line with those of the main window
