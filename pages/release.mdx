# Observatory Core Downloads

## Latest 

### v1.2.6 - Tab Order Bugfix

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.6/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.6/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Quick bugfix to address a reported possible crash when loading saved tab order.

The portable archive also no longer includes an all-defaults config file which would inadvertantly overwrite existing configs.

### v1.2.5 - Pop a Tab

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.5/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.5/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Some asked for improvements of plugin tabs and popouts are now implemented. Most notably tabs can now be re-ordered by dragging them with the mouse. 

Additionally popped out plugins now remember their popped out nature and should pop themselves back out again on Observatory launch. 

Finally, the UI should spend less time in an awkward half-drawn state during startup, this is most noticable when doing a read-all on launch, but should also be a marked improvment in general.

- Improve UX of initial UI load
- Popouts now remembered
- Tab re-ordering
- Implement duplicate title suppression for native voice notifications (fredjk)
- Fix naming of bespoke body names by Explorer (Earth isn't a primary star!) (fredjk)
- Improve Framework handling of unrecognized values for enums
- Tweak intra-plugin messaging to allow destination to be specified, prevent senders from receiving their own message, and prevent duplicate receiving by dual-role plugins. (Matt G)
