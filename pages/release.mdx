# Observatory Core Downloads

## Latest 

### v1.2.9 - Trailblazing

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.9/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.9/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

A small catchup release to add support for journal changes in and after the Trailblazers and Powerplay 2.0 updates, plus some assored missed values. If you were experiencing crashes in and around the bubble and colony systems this should resolve it.

Huge thanks for fredjk for doing most of the lifting on this one.

### v1.2.8 - Persistent Fixing

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.8/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.8/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

This release fixes an issue with persistent notifications, for real this time.

- Fix issue where updated notifications could fail to pass Guid correctly when parameters inconsistently populated.
- New `IObservatoryCore.UpdateNotification(NotificationArgs notificationEventArgs)` method which does not require redundant Guid parameter.
- `IObservatoryCore.UpdateNotification(Guid id, NotificationArgs notificationEventArgs)` is now deprecated in favour of `IObservatoryCore.UpdateNotification(NotificationArgs notificationEventArgs)`. The removal of the obsolete method is not currently planned for any specific release, however plugin developers should move away from it when possible.

### v1.2.7 - Persistence Pays Off

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.7/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.7/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

This release fixes an issue with persistent notifications, such as those used by Botanist to track current scan status, which prevented notification plugins from being able to properly handle them. This should be most interesting for anyone using MattG's Stellar Overlay.

In addition there is now an option for alternative journal monitoring which actively polls the files to check for changes. This should only be enabled if you're having issues with the normal monitoring not responding to journal changes.

- Pass generated GUID in initial NotificationArgs object for persistent notifications.
- Add option for polled journal monitoring
- Several under-the-hood fixes for settings and error handling (fredjk)


### v1.2.6 - Tab Order Bugfix

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.6/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.6/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Quick bugfix to address a reported possible crash when loading saved tab order.

The portable archive also no longer includes an all-defaults config file which would inadvertantly overwrite existing configs.

### v1.2.5 - Pop a Tab

Release versions:
  * [Installer](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.5/ObservatorySetup.exe)
  * [Portable](https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/releases/download/v1.2.5/ObservatoryPortable.zip)

Some asked for improvements of plugin tabs and popouts are now implemented. Most notably tabs can now be re-ordered by dragging them with the mouse. 

Additionally popped out plugins now remember their popped out nature and should pop themselves back out again on Observatory launch. 

Finally, the UI should spend less time in an awkward half-drawn state during startup, this is most noticable when doing a read-all on launch, but should also be a marked improvment in general.

- Improve UX of initial UI load
- Popouts now remembered
- Tab re-ordering
- Implement duplicate title suppression for native voice notifications (fredjk)
- Fix naming of bespoke body names by Explorer (Earth isn't a primary star!) (fredjk)
- Improve Framework handling of unrecognized values for enums
- Tweak intra-plugin messaging to allow destination to be specified, prevent senders from receiving their own message, and prevent duplicate receiving by dual-role plugins. (Matt G)
