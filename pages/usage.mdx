# General Usage Guide

Elite Observatory is a powerful, modular tool designed to monitor and report upon Elite Dangerous journals.

Here you'll find documentation for getting the Observatory set up, as well as detailed guides and troubleshooting for its many plugins.

## Features

  * Read and analyse all CMDR journal files
  * Configure pop-up and/or voice notifications
  * Choose from a wide array of [[startnew#Plugins|plugins]] providing expansive functionality
  * Define custom search/reporting criteria using Lua

## Installation

  * Download the latest version from [the releases page](/release).
  * Double-click on the downloaded ObservatorySetup.exe to install.
    * During setup you will be asked which supplementary [plugins](/plugins) (if any) you would like to install.
  * Once setup has finished, launch Elite Observatory as you would with any other app.

Once Observatory is started, you will see a list of installed plugins on the left. 
  * Navigate to the "Core" tab for further plugin information and settings.
  * Each other tab corresponds to a plugin, and will have its own information stored there.
  * You can access additional plugin data and logs by clicking the "Open Plugin Folder" button below the plugin list.

There are four buttons in the bottom corner:
  * The **Read All** button attempts to read and process all existing journal files, if you have any.
    * If the Read All button does nothing, your [journal path may be set incorrectly](#troubleshooting).
  * The **Start Monitor** button will allow Observatory to start monitoring changes to your journal files in real time. Clicking this button again will cease monitoring.
    * You can set up Observatory to start monitoring automatically by checking the appropriate box in the Core tab.
  * The **Clear** button will clear all currently displayed data from Observatory.
  * The **Export** button allows you to export your data to an external file. 
    * The Export Options dropdown in the Core tab allows you to customise how data is output.

## Plugins

There are many optional plugins available for the Observatory, designed to supplement and enhance the core application. 

By default, three plugins are installed along with Observatory:

  * [Explorer](/plugins/explorer): Finds interesting astronomical features while exploring
  * [Botanist](/plugins/botanist): Tracks planetary biological signals scanned on foot.
  * [Herald](/plugins/herald): Enables high-quality cloud-based speech notifications.

Additional plugins can be downloaded as .eop files and can generally be installed by simply double-clicking the file.

  * [BioInsights](/plugins/thirdparty/bioinsights): Provides in-depth detail on biological signal sources.
  * [Evaluator](/plugins/thirdparty/evaluator): Provides detailed mapping value information for system bodies.
  * [SignalMonitor](/plugins/thirdparty/signalmonitor): Detects and provides notifications for certain uncommon signal sources.
  * [GeoPredictor](/plugins/thirdparty/geopredictor): Tracks and predicts planetary geological signals.
  * [Telegram](/plugins/thirdparty/telegram): Sends notifications via Telegram messenger.

A more complete list of currently available plugins can be found [here](/plugins).

## Troubleshooting

Below is a list of FAQs for Observatory installation and setup. 

  * **I can't see/launch Observatory!**
      * Make sure you downloaded ObservatorySetup.exe- by default this should put Observatory in the your application list/Start Menu.
      * If you downloaded ObservatoryCore.zip (the portable version) then you may need to extract and run the application from there.
  * **Observatory can't read any of my data!**
      * You may need to set your journal path in the Core section of Observatory. In Windows, this path is usually C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous.
      * If you aren't sure where your journal files are, you can search for them in Windows' File Explorer by typing `Journal.*.log` into the search bar. Once you've found the folder your files are in, set Observatory's path to that folder.
      * Test that your journal folder is correct by clicking the Read All button. If you have any historical journal data, then this should now appear in Observatory.
  * **Observatory freezes/crashes when I click 'Read All!'**
    * For CMDRS with very large amounts of journal files, the Read All button may take a long time to process (up to a few minutes on slower systems). On older versions of Observatory, this will make the application unresponsive until complete.
